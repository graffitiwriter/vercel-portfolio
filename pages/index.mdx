# Spanner Spencer ðŸ”§

Hi there, I'm Spanner Spencer. Yep, it's my real name, and a long but regrettably uninteresting story.

Here we go...

## Technical Guideline
I've picked the **Linux Upskill Challenge**, and written a few words about why on [this page](https://vercel-portfolio-xi.vercel.app/posts/linux-upskill).



## What Do You Want to Learn at Work?
Ah, so much! Hopefully [this doesn't ramble on *too* long](https://vercel-portfolio-xi.vercel.app/posts/learn)!



## Temporary Redirect Task
Here's the temporary redirection task. To accomplish it, I just added just a .json file with the redirect code [found here](https://medium.com/@kartikagrawal7196/how-to-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository-36b0fd8f9bf8).

[https://vercel-portfolio-od7u7c9wo-graffitiwriter1.vercel.app/hello-vercel](
https://vercel-portfolio-od7u7c9wo-graffitiwriter1.vercel.app/hello-vercel)  -->  **vercel.com**



## GitHub Redirect Question
***Q:** "How do I do a redirect from /hello-vercel to https://vercel.com?"*

**A:** The good news is that Vercel gives you several options depending on how you've build your app. There's an excellent support article that covrs your various options here: https://vercel.com/support/articles/does-vercel-support-permanent-redirects
  
  But let's give you the short version that I find to be quick and easy, to get you moving.
  
  Create a new file called "vercel.json" in the repo's root, and open it up for editing. Here's the snippet you'll need to add the redirect (and any other redirects you might add in the future).
```  
  {
  "redirects": [
    { 
      "source": "/source",
      "destination": "https://github.com/", 
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```
Swap out "/view-source" for the subpage your redirecting from ("/hello-vercel", in your case), and change the destination to the URL you're sending people to. Once that's deployed, you should be good to go!

Always good to hear other people's methods too, so please share any other solutions too. And if you get stuck, you know where to find us!
  


## Using a Custom Doman in a Project
***Q:** "I have a custom domain which I purchased at GoDaddy and I want to use it on my project"*

**A:** You can add a custom domain to any of your Vercel projects, which is handy as it means you can mangage multiple domains and their apps all from one account. On your dashboard, open up the project you want to add the GoDaddy domain to. Click the **"Settings"** tab, followed by **"Domains"** in the left hand menu lower down.

THere you'll see an option to add your custom domain. You can do that now, and don't worry about the error you'll see. That's just because the domain isn't pointing at Vercel's nameservers yet. Before you head back to GoDaddy, click the **"Nameservers"** tab and take note of the entry in the **"Intended Nameservers"** box.

The first task in your GoDaddy hosting account is making sure your domain is unlocked. This will allow you to point it somewhere else, like your Vercel project. Now you need to swap the current nameservers GoDaddy is using for the Vercel ones you took note of previously. It might ask you to confirm by email, to make sure you're the account owner. 

Once that's done, the domain is now being pointed at your Vercell project! There's a more detailed guide on custom domains [in the docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains), or take a look at Kirsten Swansons's excellent walkthrough [here](https://kswanie21.medium.com/how-to-set-up-godaddy-domain-with-vercel-f42430ed4f6).

It can take a day or two for nameserver changes to propogate through the Interner, so don't worry if it doesn't instantly work.

Keep us posted on how it all goes!
