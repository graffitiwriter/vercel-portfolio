# Spanner Spencer 🔧

Hi there, I'm Spanner Spencer. Yep, it's my real name, and a long but regrettably uninteresting story.

## Temporary Redirect Task
This seemed as good a place as anywhere to put the temporary redirection task. To accomplish it, I just added a .json file with the redirect code [found here](https://medium.com/@kartikagrawal7196/how-to-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository-36b0fd8f9bf8).

[https://vercel-portfolio-od7u7c9wo-graffitiwriter1.vercel.app/hello-vercel](
https://vercel-portfolio-od7u7c9wo-graffitiwriter1.vercel.app/hello-vercel)  -->  **vercel.com**


This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

[**Deploy your own**](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel-solutions/nextjs-portfolio-starter&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) in a few minutes.
