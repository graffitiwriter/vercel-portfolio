# Spanner Spencer ðŸ”§

Hi there, I'm Spanner Spencer. Yep, it's my real name, and a long but regrettably uninteresting story.

Here we go...

## Technical Guideline
I've picked the **Linux Upskill Challenge**, and written a few words about why on [this page](https://vercel-portfolio-xi.vercel.app/posts/linux-upskill).



## What Do You Want to Learn at Work?
Ah, so much! Hopefully [this doesn't ramble on *too* long](https://vercel-portfolio-xi.vercel.app/posts/learn)!



## Temporary Redirect Task
Here's the temporary redirection task. To accomplish it, I just added just a .json file with the redirect code [found here](https://medium.com/@kartikagrawal7196/how-to-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository-36b0fd8f9bf8).

[https://vercel-portfolio-od7u7c9wo-graffitiwriter1.vercel.app/hello-vercel](
https://vercel-portfolio-od7u7c9wo-graffitiwriter1.vercel.app/hello-vercel)  -->  **vercel.com**



## GitHub Redirect Question
**Q:** "How do I do a redirect from /hello-vercel to https://vercel.com?"
**A:** The good news is that Vercel gives you several options depending on how you've build your app. There's an excellent support article that covrs your various options here: https://vercel.com/support/articles/does-vercel-support-permanent-redirects
  
  But let's give you the short version that I find to be quick and easy, to get you moving.
  
  Create a new file called "vercel.json" in the repo's root, and open it up for editing. Here's the snippet you'll need to add the redirect (and any other redirects you might add in the future).
```  
  {
  "redirects": [
    { 
      "source": "/source",
      "destination": "https://github.com/", 
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```
Swap out "/view-source" for the subpage your redirecting from ("/hello-vercel", in your case), and change the destination to the URL you're sending people to. Once that's deployed, you should be good to go!

Always good to hear other people's methods too, so please share any other solutions too. And if you get stuck, you know where to find us!
  


## Using a Custom Doman in a Project
**Q:** "I have a custom domain which I purchased at GoDaddy and I want to use it on my project"
**A:** The first task is making sure your domain is unlocked on your hosting. This will allow you to point it somewhere else, like your Vercel app. It varies from host to host, but GoDaddy is actually featured as an example on our [domains guide, here](https://vercel.com/guides/transferring-domains-to-vercel).

Then you have a couple of options. You can edit the nameservers in your GoDaddy hosting account to point at your Vercel app, or you could transfer the domain to Vercel. 

It's worth noting that you can [transfer domains over to Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/transferring-domains-to-vercel), so everything's together in one place. Just make sure you're more than 60 days from expiration, as some hosts won't let you transfer a domain that close to renewal dates.
  
  

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

[**Deploy your own**](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel-solutions/nextjs-portfolio-starter&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) in a few minutes.
