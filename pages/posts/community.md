# Q6) What Does Community Mean to You?

I can hear my current co-workers groan when I read this question! I take community quite literally. By that, I mean to say how important I believe it is to simply understand the word.

The word "community" literally means "joint ownership", and that's a drum I bang at every opportunity, I don't mind admitting! Too often businesses don't actually want to share, or effectively give away, ownership of a community to its members. What they're really looking for is a captive (if happy) audience. One of the reasons I gravitate toward open-source is because businesses that have adopted it typically share that same philosophy of joint ownership. The users are genuinely considered to be as integral as the developers.

So that's what community means to me. It's the part of the business and/or products that we're willing to consider to be jointly owned with the users. That's where the essential sense of belonging comes from, and the reason people feel a familial loyalty to a brand or product or company. It's no longer about give or take, commerce or economy, but a social experience in a very real meaning of the sense. They spend time on the community platform to be with friends and people who share a join vision; not because they particularly want something from it.

If it's a one-directional broadcast that's used to send out thinly veiled adverts, I don't think I'd be the best person for that job. If it's about creating a place of belonging, where members really feel that they have an influence over the direction of the business and its products, and of "finding the others" as [Doug Rushkoff](https://rushkoff.com/) likes to say (bringing new people into the community and giving them a home there), that's definitely my bag.
