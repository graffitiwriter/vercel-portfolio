# Q2) Learning at Work

## Brief:
What do you want to learn, or do more of, at work?

## Overview
Apologies if this is rambling on more than required, but I wanted to talk a little about why I'm keeping at least one eye open for new opportunities.

Working at Arduino is great. Or moreover, working *with* Arduino is great. I believe in the product, and the open-source philosophy it's built on 100%. But it's a rather old fashioned business structure, that's very risk averse and not hugely ambitious. The heirarchy is quite rigid, and the prospects for developing the community feel somewhat limited. 

Arguably the founders have built an amazing range of products that the market really desires, so it's probably not for me to say that its community strategy needs to evolve. That being said, I *really* think it's community strategy needs to evolve! Especially if we want to engage the next generation(s) of makers. So my reasons for looking - albeit casually - are actually born from a simple, but pervasive desire to do *more*. More creative experimentation; more dynamic community engagement campaigns; significantly more diverse tactics, and certainly more chances to fail. I'm more than happy to accept the responsibility for the results if the freedom to rapidly test, iterate and experiment is part of the role.

## Social, Content & Community
While these three aspects of customer engagement do have a strong role to play individually, employing them all is, in my experience, the route to a thriving, healthy community. And content is changing. Not just the shift toward video, but also toward niche audience engagement. As Seth Godin like to say, everything is niche these days (all hail the Godin!), so I want to be able to dedicate time, effort and resources to reaching those niches, engaging them, and giving them all a home in our community.

That will require a combination of social media, content creation and community management. Honestly, I don't know what shape that will take at all. It could be podcasts, webinars, AMAs, contests, design challenges, roadtests, content series (including rapidly building YouTube playlists - a very effective community building strategy). Whatever it takes to grow the community from being primarily tech support to one of experiential belonging.

## Coding
I'm very technically minded, and very good with hardware, having begun life as an electronics engineer. But I'm only *okay* with code. I can work with other people's code, but I'm not so hot with writing my own. Just like learning another language, or to play an instrument, it's been on my learning list for a long time. Were I to find a home at Vercel, I'd really love the opportunity to take advantage of the resources and people in a company like this, and finally learn to code in earnest. This would be a great new hobby for me, just as much as a work skill.

## Production Skills
I mentioned podcasting and video content creation above. I'm finding myself increasingly interested in developing creative skills around that kind of multimedia content in a more professional way. I'm an enthusiastic amateur right now, having taught myself about podcast production ([ah, yes. I have a Star Trek podcast of my own!](https://anchor.fm/startrekhi) and I'm pretty good when it comes to creating video material such as interviews, case studies, ads and marketing campaigns.

But I'm very much aware of how little I know, despite how much I've experimented in these areas. So professional development of multimedia production skills would be very interesting and, I genuinely believe, valuable to my work.


What does community mean to you?
I can make my co-workers groan when they hear this question! I take community quite literally. By that, I mean to say how important I believe it is to really understand the word.

It literally means "joint ownership", and that's a drum I bang at every opportunity, I don't mind admitting! Too often businesses don't actually want to share, or effectively give away, ownership of a community to its members. What they're really looking for is a captive (if happy) audience. One of the reasons I gravitate toward open-source is because businesses that have adopted it share typically share that same philosophy of joint ownership. The users are genuinely considered to be as integral as the developers.

If it's a one0directional broadcast system that's used to send out thinly veiled adverts, I don't think I'd be the best person for that job. If it's about creating a place of belonging, where members really feel that they have a real influence over the direction of the business and its products, and of "finding the others"
as Doug Rushkoff likes to say (bringing new people into the community and giving them a home there), that's definitely my bag.
